# hello-world
My hello-world repository. This will store everything I need to get started.

My name is Felix and I'm a business administration student who is sad about the lack of technology courses in my studies. So I will attack this myself and either learn how to code or at least understand the fundamentals.

GitHub looks amazing and it's idea is what I'm looking for!
